# wps-hide-login
WPS Hide Login is a very light plugin that lets you easily and safely change the url of the login form page to anything you want. It doesnâ€™t literally rename or change files in core, nor does it add rewrite rules. It simply intercepts page requests and works on any WordPress website. The wp-admin directory and wp-login.php page become inaccessible, so you should bookmark or remember the url. Deactivating this plugin brings your site back exactly to the state it was before.
